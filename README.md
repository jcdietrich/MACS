# M.A.C.S. - Mood-Aware Character SVG

M.A.C.S. is a playful, expressive, animated companion for Home Assistant.

It visualises Assist interactions and broader system context using a living SVG character.

Rather than showing buttons and graphs, MACS shows state, mood, and intent, giving your smart home a friendly, readable presence.

## What MACS Does
Originally, I developed Macs because I wasn't sure if my Wake Words were triggering and if Home Assistant was listening to, and understanding my requests. I wanted some feedback so that I could see what was happening. Since then, Macs has grown into more than just a friendly assistant - he now pulls data from multiple sensors and can visualise many aspects of your smart home.
<br><br>



## Design Philosophy
MACS is not a control panel.

It is:
- A companion
- A status glance
- A playful way to visualise the state of various home assistant entities.

Perfect for:
- Wall tablets
- Old iPads
- Kiosk dashboards

## Installation
- Download the Macs Card via Hacs or by clicking on the link below.
- After downloading, install the Macs integration via Settings > Devices and Services > Add Integration.
- Restart Home Assistant
- Create a new Dashboard with a "Panel (Single Card)" Layout.
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl +F5)
- Add the Macs Card to the dashboard.
- Configure as required.

## Manual & Automation Control
MACS works like any other device and exposes entities and services so automations can drive its mood and effects directly.

Use macs.set_mood to change expressions. Use number entities or the matching services to control brightness, temperature, windspeed, precipitation, and battery charge. Use switches for animations_enabled, charging, and the weather_conditions_* toggles. You can also push dialogue bubbles with send_user_message and send_assistant_message.

Typical uses:
- Trigger moods from motion, presence, or security events
- Reflect weather shifts in real time
- Create time-based routines (sleeping at night, happy in the morning)

This makes MACS fully scriptable and system-driven, not just reactive to Assist.

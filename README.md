# M.A.C.S. – Mood-Aware Contextual SVG

M.A.C.S. is a playful, expressive, animated companion for Home Assistant. 

It visualises Assist interactions and broader system context using a living SVG character.

Rather than showing buttons and graphs, MACS shows state, mood, and intent, giving your smart home a friendly, readable presence.

## ✨ What MACS Does

MACS reacts visually to multiple layers of Home Assistant context:

### 🗣️ Assist Interaction
- Wake Word Trigger
- Listening
- Thinking
- Responding
- Confused / Error

### 🌦️ System State Awareness
- Weather conditions
- Temperature (ambient or configured sensor)
- Environmental context (e.g. hot / cold / windy / rain)

### 🏠 Event-Driven Reactions
- Motion detection
- Presence changes
- Custom HA events
- Automation triggers

All of this is expressed through:
- Mood
- Facial expression
- Animation
- Subtle visual cues (eyes, posture, motion)


<br><br>
## 🧠 Design Philosophy
MACS is not a control panel.

It is:
- A companion
- A status glance
- A confidence signal that your home heard you and is doing something

Perfect for:
- Wall tablets
- Old iPads
- Kiosk dashboards
- Ambient displays


<br><br>
## 🎛️ Manual & Automation Control
MACS exposes a custom service: macs.set_mood

This allows any Home Assistant automation to directly control MACS’s mood.

You can trigger mood changes based on:
- Motion detection
- Presence
- Weather changes
- Time of day
- Security events
- Any HA state, event, or condition

This makes MACS fully scriptable and system-driven, not just reactive to Assist.

## Installation
- Install the Macs Card. 
- Obtain the Assistant Pipeline ID. 
- Add the ID to the Macs Card.
- (HACS instructions coming once published.)



### Add to a Dashboard
Add the MACS card and configure:
- Assist pipeline ID

The card automatically sends:
- Assist state
- System context
- Event triggers  
to the display.

## 🧭 Roadmap
Macs is very much in Beta stage and as of JDecember 29th, 2025, is under heavy development.

Feedback is welcome and valuable:
- Bugs → open an issue
- Videos/screenshots → massively helpful
- Platform quirks → especially tablets

This project is evolving by use, not speculation.
